# MateCat Win Converter

MateCat Win Converter helps MateCat Filters supporting more formats doing some auxiliary file conversions.

## Getting started

First check the dependencies needed:

* In order to support legacy Office formats (like doc, ppt, xls) you need Microsoft Office 2010 or later installed.
* In order to support OCR of image formats you need the OCR Console by Nuance.
* In order to support PDFs you need an API key from [CloundConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/). You can obtain one creating a new free account [here](https://cloudconvert.com/user/registration).

Create a config file in the same folder of the executable and carefully set all the parameters. See `App.sample.config` for a configuration example.

Ensure also to have MateCat Filters properly configured to connect to the MateCatWinConverter instance you are creating.

*That's it!* Now you are ready to run MateCat Win Converter and MateCat Filters to convert all your files!
